Hello everyone, and welcome to the all-new website for the Cardinal Guild!
Right now everything is very much under construction, but as of now the very basics are up and running, such as the [map][web-map] and [surveying database][surveyors-link], so if you'd like to contribute to the efforts, feel free to do so! If you want to keep in touch with us make sure to join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ezjfcY4) for all the latest developments.

That's all for now, but hopefully we'll get things sorted out as soon as possible!

All the best,
